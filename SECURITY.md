# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
I currently maintain only the `main` branch of this project. Security updates will be applied there as needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** create a public issue.  
Instead, email me directly at **[ 105845499+mbvgua@users.noreply.github.com ]**.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact youâ€™ve identified
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

I will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**.
2. Investigate and confirm the issue.
3. Release a fix and publicly disclose the vulnerability once it is resolved (or determine it is not a vulnerability).

## Responsible Disclosure
Please give me a reasonable time to address the issue before sharing it publicly.  Following responsible disclosure helps protect the users of this project.

Thanks for helping keep this project secure!
