# Contributing to Hermes

Hi! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for your interest in contributing. Even though this project is currently maintained by a single developer (me), I welcome help, ideas, and improvements.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the [Issues tab](../../issues) to report bugs or suggest features.
- Please be as specific as possible, including:
  - Steps to reproduce (if itâ€™s a bug)
  - Screenshots or examples
  - Environment details (OS, browser, etc.)

### 2. Suggesting Features
- Open an issue with the **Feature Request** label.
- Explain the problem your feature would solve and why itâ€™s valuable.

### 3. Making Changes
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch:  

```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-name
```

- Commit your changes with a clear message.
- Push to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.

### 4. Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep PRs focusedâ€”avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- Make sure the code builds and passes any existing tests.
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and formatting.
- Keep things simple and readable.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files.

## Communication
- Please keep discussions respectful and constructive.
- I may not merge PRs immediately, but I will review them as soon as I can.

Thanks for helping make this project better!
